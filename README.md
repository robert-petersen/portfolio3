## Dependencies

### React

A JavaScript framework and library created by Facebook (Meta) thats used to build user interfaces quickly and with less code than vanilla JavaScript. Create reusable components to build your application following **DRY**. React aslo has a more efficient method of manipulating the DOM to render web pages faster. React docs can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

### Sass

A CSS preprocesser that includes great features like variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance. Great for updating colors and themes quickly with variables, and for creating mixins for commonly used CSS, like centering elements within a container. Sass docs can be found [here](https://sass-lang.com/guide).
```
// create a mixin
@mixin center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

// use your mixin
.container {
  @include center;
}
```

### React Router

React Router enables "client side routing". Client side routing allows your app to update the URL from a link click without making another request for another document from the server. This enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for the next page. React router docs can be found [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

### React Icons

A great library for tons of icons that can easily be imported. Uses ES6 imports so you can import only the icons you need. Docs can be found [here](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

### React Scroll

A react library that provides tools to easily animate vertical scrolling. Docs can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll).

## Portfolio Iterations

A portfolio website for a web developer is a great way to show off your skills, experience, and things about you. As you grow and improve as a developer your portfolio should grow and improve as well. I thought sharing old portfolio designs (even if they are embarassing) would be fun and show my progress as a developer. Below are my past iterations of portfolios, some thoughts on them, and what I am planning for the future.

- [Beginner Attempt](#beginner-attempt)
- [Second Portfolio](#second-portfolio)
- [Current Portfolio](#current-portfolio)
- [Future Portfolio](#future-portfolio)

### Beginner Attempt

My first portfolio was created in my first month at Lambda School, now known as <a href="https://www.bloomtech.com/" target="_blank" rel=”noreferrer”>Bloom Institute of Technology</a>. We were told to give creating one a try one day when we were first learning HTML and CSS. This one predictably turned out pretty bad in a funny way. It reminds me of a horrible MySpace page. I plan to try to find the hideous website and github repo and display it here along with photos.

### Second Portfolio

This was my first real attempt at a portfolio website. I created it using React and <a href="https://styled-components.com/" traget="_blank" rel=”noreferrer”>Styled Components</a>. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/robert-petersen/portfolio2" target="_blank" rel="norefferer" >Github repo</a> and the <a href="https://robert-petersen-old.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="norefferer">deployed website</a>.

### Current Portfolio

This version is a refactor of the previous version plus a few new features and content. I decided to switch my styles from Styled Components to SASS. I felt Styled Components was less popular and SASS offers alot of great features while sticking closer to traditional CSS practices. This version is also a way to strat reworking the functionality of the website and eventulally the styles and themes as well.

### Future Portfolio
<!-- final portfolio here -->
<!-- New repo or just make changes / at least have a legacy branch to show growth screenshots later on -->

## Future Improvements

### "Hacked" View

In the future I plan on including a "hacking minigame" to be found that will unlock a new view to display game like projects I create.
